# ProyectoED
 ProyectoED  This is a Data Structures project for the 2024 evaluation period that involves creating a Contact Management System. The project, developed in groups, requires designing and implementing a system that organizes contacts with various attributes, such as name, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and social media links. Users should be able to **add, edit, delete, and navigate contacts**, with features for **sorting and filtering contacts based on attributes like birthday, company, or type** (individual or business).  The interface should allow seamless contact navigation, including circular scrolling (forward and backward through contacts). Core functionality includes creating contact templates for individuals and businesses, editing attributes, and managing contact relationships (e.g., linking a contact to their assistant or related family members). Optional features for extra points include advanced search, contact tagging, export/import options, favorites, and multiple user logins with separate contact directories.  Data persistence is required through files, with no use of databases.
